# Java Macro Agent-Based (JMAB) toolkit - "Benchmark" model

Copyright (c) 2016 Alessandro Caiani and Antoine Godin

## Overview

The folder contains the model-specific code empolyed for the model presented in the working paper available <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2664125"> here</a> , the summary tables of the experiments discussed in the paper, and additional materials to run simulations by your own and analyze results.

The code requires and builds upon the JMAB platform (<a href="https://github.com/S120/jmab">JMAB project</a>): a Java framework for building macro stock-flow consistent agent-based simulation models. A simulation model is constructed using <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a> by creating a <a href="https://blog.mafr.de/2007/11/01/configuration-with-spring-beans/">Spring beans</a> configuration file which specifies which classes to use in the simulation and the values of any attributes (parameters). The Spring configuration file is specified using the system property jabm.config.

The main application class is DesktopSimulationManager

## Additional Contents

The folder "paper" contains:
- The pdf document of the working paper presenting the model (<a href="https://github.com/S120/benchmark/blob/master/benchmark/paper/BenchmarkModel.pdf"> here</a>)

- The Summary Tables with the quasi-SS characterization in the Baseline Scenario and the Sensitivity Experiments (<a href="https://github.com/S120/benchmark/tree/master/benchmark/paper/Benchmark%20Model%20-%20Similation%20Results"> here</a>) discussed in the working paper available <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2664125"> here</a> 

- The Summary Tables of the Cross Correlation Analysis in the Baseline and in each Sensitivity experiment. See the "Correlations" folders within the "Baseline" and "Sensitivity" folders <a href="https://github.com/S120/benchmark/tree/master/benchmark/paper/Benchmark%20Model%20-%20Similation%20Results"> here</a>

- All the Plots Produced in the Experiments. In the case of the sensitivity experiments lighter grey lines correspond to higher values of the parameter. Baseline: <a href="https://github.com/S120/benchmark/tree/master/benchmark/paper/Benchmark%20Model%20-%20Similation%20Results/Baseline"> here</a>. Sensitivity: <a href="https://github.com/S120/benchmark/tree/master/benchmark/paper/Benchmark%20Model%20-%20Similation%20Results/Sensitivity"> here</a>

- The Executable Files to run simulations of the benchmark model by your own (in both the Baseline and Sensitivity Scenarios) and the R Scripts required to transform and analyze the results, and plot the figures. (See Read Me doc. in the “Launch Simulations” Folder). Available <a href="https://github.com/S120/benchmark/tree/master/benchmark/paper/Benchmark%20Model%20-%20Similation%20Results/Launch%20Simulations"> here</a>.

## Prerequisites

JMAB requires Java version 6 or later. It has been tested against version 1.6.0_35 and 1.7.0_75.

Note that on Mac OS, you will need to use the Oracle version of Java instead of the default one shipped with the OS.

## Installation

The project archive can be imported directly into the Eclipse IDE as an existing project.

## Running the examples from the Eclipse IDE

The distribution archive can be imported directly into the Eclipse IDE by using the File/Import menu item. Create a launch configuration in the benchmark project with the main class benchmark.Main and specify which configuration file you want to use by setting the system property jabm.config using the JVM argument -D , for example

-Djabm.config=model/mainBaseline.xml

## Documentation

The folder documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/S120/jmab">JMAB project</a> contains a user guide.

The folder paper contains the last working paper version of the model description, plus the data generated by the simulation used for the paper, and the corresponding graphs. It also contains a jar that can be used to run the simulation directly from the console
